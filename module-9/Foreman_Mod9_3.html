  <h1>Assignment 9.3: JavaScript - Part 1</h1>

  <p>
    It was early morning when the small group gathered at the edge of the forest. The path ahead was quiet, and the trees
    swayed gently as if whispering about the unknown <span id="adventure">_________</span> that waited beyond the hill.
  </p>

  <p>
    Maya gripped her backpack and smiled. She’d waited for this day with more <span id="courage">_________</span> than fear.
    The long trail ahead didn’t scare her—it reminded her of how much she’d grown since her first hike years ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the trail opened to a clearing, she stopped to watch the
    <span id="sunrise">_________</span> pour light across the valley. It felt like a quiet promise that the journey would be worth it.
    The air was calm, filled with the scent of pine and the soft hum of life waking up around her.
  </p>

  <p>
    She took a deep breath, looked toward the horizon, and felt a sense of
    <span id="freedom">_________</span> that she hadn’t known in a long time.
    Sometimes the best moments are the ones that remind us to simply keep moving forward.
