        <h2>Chapter 1: Formatting</h2>
        <p class="intro">
            I was born and raised in Lincoln, NE. I have a six brothers and one sister. 
            <span class="sentence">Being the middle child, it has always been an adventure.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            During my childhood, I spent a lot of time outdoors, exploring nature and playing sports with friends. 
            Those experiences taught me teamwork, patience, and perseverance. 
            Lincoln holds many memories that continue to shape who I am today.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some of my hobbies include camping, traveling, and spending time with my kids. 
            I have two boys, ages 13 and 10. 
            We all enjoy the same hobbies when it comes to being outdoors or playing board games.
        </p>

        <p>
            Family is also very important to me. Spending time together creates a sense of support and encouragement. 
            Whether it's enjoying a simple meal or taking a trip, these moments strengthen our connection and bring joy. 
            I am thankful for the balance between family, education, and personal growth.
